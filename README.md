# Slingshot

Video Demo: https://youtu.be/oUcmyhnabeE

## Description: 
This is a web-based game written with JavaScript. 
This game utilised a physics engine called Matter.js. I recommend reading the documentation if you want to understand the jargons used. 

## How to Play:
This game is inspired by Angry Bird. Gameplay is basically “A clone of Angry Birds”. 
There is a sling on the left. You can click on it, and release it. A ball shall be shot after you "released". You can keep playing again by pressing on the "AGAIN" button. 

## Levels:
As of now, there are 2 levels in this game (more may be added in future). 
The first level is just plain boxes, with a sling.
Level 2 features a huge and angry bird, ready to wreck havoc onto anything in front of him. 

## Engine: 
You can download Matter.js from https://brm.io/matter-js/. Just put the script in the same directory as the application.
