# Slingshot

You can see my video Demo here: https://youtu.be/oUcmyhnabeE

## Description: 

This is a web-based game written with JavaScript. 
This game utilised a physics engine called Matter.js. I recommend reading the documentation if you want to understand the jargons used. 

**Project Aim:**
Aim of the project was to understand a physics engine used in game development. 

**How to Play:**

This game is inspired by Angry Bird. Gameplay is basically “A clone of Angry Birds”. 
There is a sling on the left. You can click on it, and release it. A ball shall be shot after you "released". You can keep playing again by pressing on the "AGAIN" button. 

**Levels:**

As of now, there are 2 levels in this game (more may be added in future). 
The first level is just plain boxes, with a sling.
Level 2 features a huge and angry bird, ready to wreck havoc onto anything in front of him. 

**Engine:** 
You can download Matter.js from https://brm.io/matter-js/. Just put the script in the same directory as the application. 

**Decription of Files:** 
- Level 1. html - Code for Level 1 of the game
- Level 2. html - Code for level 2 of the game
- Matter.js - Physics Engine, which is the basis of the game
- README.md - This file, with all the descriptions to fulfill 500 words
- requirements.txt - I generated this to ensure app can be used on other computers
- Slingshot.pptx - The slide I made while I make a video
- styles.css - CSS used for HTML webpages 

**Instructions to use locally:**
1. Open up a terminal window
2. Check your version type python --version
3. The required modules are listed. Install the required modules either one by one or by typing in pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Generate a http-server. If you are using Python, type *python -m http.server*
5. Everything should be ready to go at this point. Click on the link that appear to use it. 

**Possible Improvements**
1. Obviously, I can create more levels.  
2. I can generate levels that are more tricky. 
3. I tried and failed to make randomly generated levels. This is really tricky to implement. But I feel it should be doable. Procedurally generated levels will save so much time. 
3. I can generate a menu that goes to all the level. 
4. Maybe I can create different kind of birds, each who have different abilities and powers then released from the slingshots. 
5. I can introduce different enemies as well, instead of just blocks. 
6. I can probably port this to android/iOS. But first, I have to learn iOS and Android development. 
7. Lastly, I can also introduce microtransactions! But why....

**Future Goals**
0. First off, this is personal and nothing to do with the project. 
1. Learn R
2. Do different projects with Python. Mostly with data visualisation, as it seems interesting. 
3. Learn a different framework, maybe build a different project. 
4. Consider exploring other modules of CS50. 
5. Visual Code Studio is really good. 
6. Maybe I can take a Masters? 

Have I reached 500 words yet?
